# Graphene Codes
These files are just a tiny part of the project. These codes generate the electronic band structure of Graphene based on Analytical calculations. This can serve as a useful resource for teaching. However, I have also created codes that do not reguire analytical calculations of the ovelap of orbitals. Codes can be made available upon proper request.
